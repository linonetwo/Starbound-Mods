Mod Name: Bigger Shiplocker
Version: 1.1 Furious Koala
Author: SpaceKitten
Support URL: http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?resources/bigger-shiplocker.226/

Description:
This mod increases the amount of slots of your Shiplocker from 64 to 256.

To get it working with already existing characters, do the following:
1. First of all, clear your ship! Move everything out or it will get lost after these changes.
2. Now open the /player directory and delete the file *.shipworld of your existing character (or move it to another location if you want a backup).
3. If you start the game now, your existing character will have a resetted ship with the bigger Shiplocker.

This mod works in multiplayer for all players who have this mod installed. For others, the game might crash when accessing the Shiplocker.
