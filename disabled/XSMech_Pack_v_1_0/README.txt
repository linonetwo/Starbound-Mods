--------------------------------------

	HOW TO INSTALL
--------------------------------------

NORMAL INSTALL

1. Delete any previous versions of this mod
2. Copy the mod_xsmech folder into \Steam\steamapps\common\Starbound\mods
3. Start Starbound and enjoy!


--------------------------------------

	HOW TO GET TECH
--------------------------------------

Sigma Mech Tech

Crafted at the robotic crafting table for 750 pixels. The weapons are semi-balanced with T3 or T4 in mind.
Right now the crafting costs and weapon damage are not balanced with normal progression in mind, for testing
purposes.

--------------------------------------

	NOTE
--------------------------------------

Keep in mind this is a mod for a game in beta. All balancing is subject to change--I am waiting for Starbound to get closer to
final release before tweaking balance for these items. Starbound beta patches are likely to break elements of this mod; I will
try to keep the mod working for the latest patch and definitely for final release.
