    "Let's start off with myself. I'm Divewings the Loremaster. Long ago I served an Avian priest that tasked me to explore the world and discover as much as I could about other races. When I returned with my findings, he wasn't happy. He had meant for me to figure out tactics to defeat other races, not study them. I protested, and I became a member of the grounded. I then began travelling the universe, finding its secrets.",

    "First-mate Love-Jones lived on an island paradise on Earth before the tentacle monster attacked. Working at a military base gave them access to many technologies which they gladly experimented with. When the tentacle monster attacked Love-Jones was ordered to take a ship and run with some of these items. Similar to your predicament, the ship crashed a while later, and that's where you found him.",
	
	"Chef Goldobot was created by one of King Kernelbot's scientist. In order to be the ultimate chef he was created as a faulty glitch, and loaded with some of the Glitch's recipes. As his skills improved the faulty Goldobot began to truly enjoy cooking, and knowing he was doomed to a life of cooking slavery, fled in the night. He then explored the universe finding recipe after recipe, continuing his journey to be the best chef.",
	
	"I tried to talk to Ashblazer about his history, but he simply laughed, and mentioned something about being confused, then running towards after Love-Jones' dog. Apologies captain!",
	
	"Dr. Genekong was a very succesful scientist, and was even rumored to have met the Minikong. Apparently practical jokes aren't taken well by the Minikong, as Genekong found out, when he exclaimed he was a better scientist than them. Exiled from his research position, Genekong has been found experimenting in random Apex facilities until you offered him a new job.",
	
	"Dr. Spongewaltzer was well known for his medicine all across the Hylotl worlds, which he refused to disclose the locations of. Some Floran must have known, however, as Spongewaltzer was captured and forced to help create new stims for the Floran slave masters.",
	
	"Thorngrazer the hunter was actually raised by Hylotl parents, who found him the ruins of a Floran village that had been razed by Argaran. Raised to be more at peace with nature, Thorngrazer still had the spirit of the hunter, and after hearing about his origin, has vowed to destroy the Argaran. Luckily this means he gets along fairly well with Dr. Spongewaltzer!"
